Project: Network Client Library 

Description: This DLL/LIB connects any client application to RakNet (see sampleClient and sampleXVRclient for how to connect). 
Comments in client.h provides more indepth explanations. The client (sampleClient) acts as a thin client, in that 
it simply connects to the server and simply sends and recieves data from server.

Dependencies: RakNet Static Library project included in the same visual studio solution file. See external_libs directoy on the svn.
