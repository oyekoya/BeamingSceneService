Mac OS X Instructions
------------------
How to install Raknet, libclient on OsX.

-RakNet

NOTE: Use preferably GNU gcc to compile. to do so, set an environmental var before each CMAKE call:
CC=gcc CXX=g++ cmake (...)

NOTE2: There's no __int32 on mac, on $RAKNET/Source/NativeTypes.h add
#if defined(__APPLE__)
typedef int __int32;
#endif

1) cd into the raknet root directory (external_libs/rakent). cd into the Source dir, 
    and change NativeTypes.h with NativeTypes_OSX.h (by physically renaming the files).
2) if you've cmake GUI, run it and disable the dependencies. Otherwise type
	cmake .
3) cmake will tell you that the dependencies can't be found. Please do run again cmake 
    with the flag to disable them (cmake will tell you the flag)
	cmake -FLAG_CMAKE_SUGGESTS .
4) type make
5) make will fail on about 75%. We don't care, we already have the static library. 
    Is in Lib/LibStatic/libRakNetStatic.a
6) copy it in /usr/lib/
	sudo cp Lib/LibStatic/libRakNetStatic.a /usr/lib/
7) you are done.

-LibClient

1) cd into netManager
2) run osx_build
	./osx_build
3) you should get everything working fine. If not, check the paths in osx_build.
4) copy libclient (netClent/libclient.a) into /usr/lib/
	sudo cp netClent/libclient.a /usr/lib/
5) you are done.

Now you can build the app. Make sure you've Qt installed!
