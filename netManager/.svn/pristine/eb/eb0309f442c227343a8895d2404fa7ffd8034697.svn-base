Notes on changes and resolved issues arising from 2nd Year Review<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Improvements made to Raknet client-server architecture to allow each client to set packet priority, reliability and auto-update interval. <br />
See client.h for instructions.<br />
<br />
NetServer executable and netClient library (was using 100% CPU) - resolved using RakSleep(1) ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
ID_LOST_CONNECTIONS and Clients updating only once was caused by the implementation of the 3 optional default parameters - resolved by specifying the optional parameters when calling startclient(...2,1,30) ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
Startclient function modified to allow clients to specify server port argument (instead of local port argument). Local ports are now automatically assigned ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
On ID_CONNECTION_LOST, client application attempts reconnection. This should resolve intermittent network disconnections ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
Int n = getPeersInfo(&amp;pointerto string); returns how many peers are actually connected and the following infos<br />
{0,"VISITOR", "Luigi", 1, VISITOR, "Paolo", 3, "SPECTATOR", "Eduardo"} where TYPES: VISITOR, PROXY, LOCAL, SPECTATOR, ROBOT, HAPTIC_DEVICE, ... ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
Returns how many nodes or float N = GetPeerData(INDEX, &amp;pointerto string, &amp;pointerto floats) (an extension of the Fetch function) ==&gt; DONE<br />
NOTE: Fetch function assumes labels are numbers (0...n). An addtional parameter (pointer to string) in GetPeerData returns the labels\object-id <br />
<br />
Returns information about specific nodes float GetPeerSpecificData((INDEX, "label") ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
Extend Beaming Scene which simply supports AVATAR data mainly: to include shared\replicated objects for Emotion, Facial, Camera, 3D streams, etc. ==&gt; DONE<br />
<br />
<u>IMPORTANT</u>: All AVATAR data types should adhere to the Rocketbox standard as agreed during the development of the initial theatre application.<br />
<br />
Visitors and Locals should have different client types, eg. &quot;VISITOR&quot; and &quot;LOCAL&quot; instead of just &quot;AVATAR&quot;. This just needs to be agreed by the clients concerned.<br />
<br />
When an AVATAR is now added, it is added in the Rocketbox avatar format. Clients also have the ability to add multiple avatars.<br />
<br />
Connection to non-raknet clients (e.g IBM SL) - XMPP library<br />
<br />
Avatar joints can now be extracted in world-coordinates<br />
<br />
Extend Beaming Scene to support GENERIC data types. ==&gt; DONE<br />
